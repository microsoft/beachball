For most uses you probably do not need any specific configuration on each package within your repository. But there are a couple of options to customize `beachball`'s behavior.

### Configurating beacbhall

There are two types of configurations:

1. repository config
2. package config

### Configuration files (cosmiconfig)

Each type of configuration can be specified one of several ways. The configuration of beachball is provided by [`cosmiconfig`](https://github.com/davidtheclark/cosmiconfig), therefore, you can specify configuration in different kinds of files (and even as CLI arguments).

- `beachball` key inside `package.json`
- .beachballrc
- .beachballrc.json
- beachball.config.js

> Be consistent! We encourage you to use the same convention within the same monorepo! When in doubt, just use `beachball.config.js`.

### `beachball.config.js`

By far the most flexible of these is, of course, the type of configuration written in JavaScript (exposed as a CommonJS module). We'll concentrate on this type of configuration.

```js
module.exports = {
  key: value,
  key2: value2
  key3: value3
}
```

You can place these in either the root of a repo or within a package like so (package config overrides the repo configuration where applicable). For example:

```
packages/
  foo/
    src/
    package.json
    beachball.config.js
  bar/
    src/
    package.json
package.json
beachball.config.js
```
