  bump                - bumps versions as well as generating changelogs

  --help, -?, -h      - this very help message
  --yes, -y           - skips the prompts for publish
  --package, -p       - manually specify a package to create a change file; creates a change file regardless of diffs
  --changehint        - give your developers a customized hint message when they forget to add a change file
  --since             - for bump command: allows to specify the range of change files used to bump packages by using git refs (branch name, commit SHA, etc);
                        for publish command: bumps and publishes packages based on the specified range of the change files.
  --keep-change-files - for bump and publish commands: when specified, both bump and publish commands do not delete the change files on the disk.
