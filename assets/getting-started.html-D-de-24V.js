One reason that this ecosystem is so vibrant and agile is its ability to share code via npm packages. Developers publishing npm packages have to keep track of what&#39;s changed in their code to determine how to bump versions, then make sure the versions in their git repo stay in sync with the npm registry...what a hassle!</p><p><code>beachball</code> helps streamline this process. As developers make PRs, it helps track the types and details of changes being made. Then when it&#39;s time to publish a new version, <code>beachball</code> automates publishing version bumps to npm, generating changelogs, and syncing changes back to the git repo.</p><h2 id="beachball-workflow" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#beachball-workflow"><span>Beachball workflow</span></a></h2><p><code>beachball</code> fits into your workflow without any extra configuration (by default).</p><p>For the workflow, a <s>picture</s> diagram is worth a thousand words, so here it is:</p>',7)),i(t,{code:"eJxdkD0OwjAMhfeewmIqQzkCAxsSQwVsVYemtZKgNAn5Gbg9TgKldLDs9+zIn8PdYAXcTxWAxxBt3TrzwDHALak92VJrdMoYW59TBRcqk29d3Ual4IrPiD5kKzIlvSA/52SNYtAcleHdUh3mqacOl6GjAIfWJK3t3FGQ5tIH9+qrLxM0zfGHsUaiDjAcRsEGIikb8rR1mfC//8ErA6VOO9b2ArnxCXTjEGoGjKx84Q52JFcHZ1Xe5eMoo56qNzoWdUc="}),e[1]||(e[1]=a('<p><strong>Inner loop:</strong> When you&#39;ve made some commits to your branch, simply run <a href="../cli/change"><code>beachball change</code></a> to generate change files.</p><p><strong>Pull request:</strong> The PR build runs <a href="../cli/check"><code>beachball check</code></a> to verify change files are included.
