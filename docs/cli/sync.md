# `sync`

Synchronizes the local version number of each package to the current version of the given `dist-tag` in the npm registry. This is useful for helping get a repo back into a valid state after publishing fails partway through.

By default, the local version will only be updated if it's **older** than the version the specified `dist-tag` points to. Use `--force` to override this behavior.

After syncing, be sure to commit and push the changes.

### Options

In addition to the options below, certain [common options](./options) also apply.

#### `--force`

Force the sync command to skip the version comparison and use the version in the registry as is.

#### `--tag, -t`

Sync with the version this `dist-tag` points to. Defaults to the tag from repo, group, or package level beachball configs if present, falling back to `latest`.
