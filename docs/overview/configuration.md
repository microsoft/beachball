# Configuration

For most uses you probably do not need any specific configuration on each package within your repository. But there are a few options to customize `beachball`'s behavior.

There are two types of configurations:

1. repository config
2. package config

## Configuration files

`beachball` uses [`cosmiconfig`](https://github.com/davidtheclark/cosmiconfig) to read its configuration, so you can specify configuration in several ways (in addition to CLI arguments).

- `"beachball"` key inside `package.json`
- `.beachballrc`
- `.beachballrc.json`
- `beachball.config.js`

### `beachball.config.js`

In many cases, you'll want to use a JavaScript config file (written as a CommonJS module), since this is the most flexible and allows comments.

```js
module.exports = {
  key: value,
  key2: value2
  key3: value3
}
```

Config files can be placed in either the root of a repo and/or within individual packages (package config overrides the repo config where applicable). For example:

```
packages/
  foo/
    src/
    package.json
    beachball.config.js
  bar/
    src/
    package.json
package.json
beachball.config.js
```

It's also common to have a repo-level `beachball.config.js` and any individual package overrides (if they're simple) in the `"beachball"` key in the package's `package.json`.

## Options
