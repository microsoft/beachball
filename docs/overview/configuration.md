# Configuration

For most uses you probably do not need any specific configuration on each package within your repository. But there are a few options to customize `beachball`'s behavior.

There are two types of configurations:

1. repository config
2. package config

## Repository config

`beachball` uses [`cosmiconfig`](https://github.com/davidtheclark/cosmiconfig) to read its configuration, so you can specify configuration in several ways (in addition to CLI arguments).

- `"beachball"` key inside `package.json`
- `.beachballrc`
- `.beachballrc.json`
- `beachball.config.js` (CJS or ESM depending on your project setup; explicit `.cjs` or `.mjs` is also supported)

It's most common to use a JavaScript file for the repo-level config, since it's the most flexible and allows comments. Usually this file is at the repo root.

The `beachball.config.js` example below uses JSDoc type annotations to enable intellisense in some editors (these are optional).

```js
// @ts-check
/** @type {import('beachball').BeachallConfig} */
const config = {
  disallowedChangeTypes: ['major'],
  changehint: 'Run "yarn change" to generate a change file',
  groupChanges: true,
};
module.exports = config;
```

## Package config

Package-level configuration is currently only supported under the `beachball` key in `package.json`.

For example, suppose the repo config above is at `beachball.config.js` at the repo root, and there are these other files:

```
packages/
  foo/
    package.json
  bar/
    package.json
beachball.config.js
package.json
```

To change the `disallowedChangeTypes` for package `foo`, you could add the following to `packages/foo/package.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "foo",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "beachball": {
    "disallowedChangeTypes": null
  }
}
```

## Options

For the latest full list of supported options, see `RepoOptions` [in this file](https://github.com/microsoft/beachball/blob/master/src/types/BeachballOptions.ts).

"Applies to" indicates where the settings can be specified: repo-level config or package-level config.

### Scoping

The `scope` option allows limiting which packages are considered. You can set it in the config file if it should always apply, or on the command line for a specific operation.

This option takes a list of patterns which are matched against package paths. Patterns are relative to the monorepo root and must use forward slashes. Negations are supported.

Example: with this config, `beachball` will only consider packages under `packages/foo` (excluding `packages/foo/bar`).

```json
{
  "scope": ["packages/foo/*", "!packages/foo/bar"]
}
```

On the command line, this could be specified as `--scope 'packages/foo/*' --scope '!packages/foo/bar'` (don't forget the quotes!).

> Note: if you have multiple sets of packages in the repo with different scopes, `groupChanges` is not supported.

### Determining the target branch and remote

The `branch` option is the official target branch to compare against when determining changes. Usually it should be a name only, though you can also include a remote. The default is the system default branch name (`main` or `master`) and the official remote.

To let `beachball` reliably determine the official remote, it's recommended to specify `repository` in the repo root `package.json`. This allows matching via URL regardless of what the user decided to call the remote.

If `repository` isn't specified and `branch` doesn't include a remote, the fallback is `upstream` if defined, `origin` if defined, or the first defined remote.
