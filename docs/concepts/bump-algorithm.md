# Bump Algorithm

Bumping a single package is a simple task of just looking up a change file for its change type and using semver to bump the version according to what that change type is.

Things get a bit more complicated when we introduce the concepts of version groups and dependent package bumping. For the sake of describing this algorithm, we can take a look at the following graph:

```mermaid
graph TD
  app --> fooLib
  fooLib --> fooUtils
  app --> componentLib

  subgraph "utils"
    fooUtils --> styleUtils
    fooUtils --> dateUtils
  end
```

### Dependent version bumping

In the above example, the `app` package is dependent on `fooLib`. Let's assume that the developer has created a `minor` change inside `fooLib`. By default, `beachball` will also bump `app` with a `patch` change type, like this:

```mermaid
graph TD
  app -. patch .-> appNext["app'"]
  fooLib -. minor .-> fooLibNext["fooLib'"]

  subgraph "current"
    app --> fooLib
  end

  subgraph "bumped"
    appNext --> fooLibNext
  end
```

To modify what the dependent package bumped change type would be (e.g. making `app` also bump with `minor` in the above example), you have to modify the change file to specify this. Here's an example of a change file under `/changes`:

```diff
{
  "comment": "Upgrading fooLib",
  "type": "patch",
  "packageName": "fooLib",
  "email": "me@me.me",
  "commit": "b785112c03f063b71d936ff052470817019267d4",
  "date": "2019-06-20T22:54:59.172Z",
+ "dependentChangeType": "minor"
}
```

### Grouped bumping

In the above example, `fooUtils`, `styleUtils`, `dateUtils` all belong to a `utils` group. Whenever one of those packages get bumped, the entire group would get bumped by the same change type. We can illustrate it like so:

```mermaid
graph TD
  subgraph "utils"
    fooUtils --> styleUtils
    fooUtils --> dateUtils
  end

  subgraph "utils'"
    fooUtilsNext[fooUtils'] --> styleUtilsNext["styleUtils'"]
    fooUtilsNext --> dateUtilsNext["dateUtils'"]
  end

  fooUtils -. minor .-> fooUtilsNext
  styleUtils -. minor .-> styleUtilsNext
  dateUtils -. minor .->dateUtilsNext
```

> NOTE: the group get bumped together even if it is part of a dependent package bump. In other words, package bumps propagate their changes via dependent package bumps as well as group package bumps.
